GraphicsProgramming
===================

Demos related to **OpenGL**, **Qt**, **OpenCV** and other X technologies.

IngressLogoGL
--------------
This is a OpenGL/Qt demo that renders the Ingress logo on a texture and performs a blur to add a *cool* effect to the logo.

cvVideo
--------------
An application that shows how to create a Qt window to display videos loaded with OpenCV.

cvImage
--------------
A simple Qt/OpenCV example that displays an image and the RGB values of a pixel based on the mouse coordinates.

cvQTcameraGL
--------------
This application uses OpenCV to retrieve frames from the camera and display them on a QGLWidget.

ipcQTgesture
--------------
A Qt application that uses UtilPipeline (IntelÂ® Perceptual Computing SDK 2013) for gesture recognition. This one is Windows only!

cvDisplacementMapFilter
--------------
An app that implements the Displacement Map Filter to distort a movie clip. 

QtFPSvsTIMEanimation
--------------
A Qt implementation of FPS-based and Time-based animation techniques, as explained by Steven Lambert:

cvWatershedSegmentation
--------------
A simple watershed segmentation example using distance transform to segment beans.

QtSerial
--------------
An application that prints data from a serial (COM) port connected to an Arduino.

qtKinectVideo
--------------
An application based on "Color Basics" from Kinect for Windows SDK 1.8. 
This demo shows how to display the Color Stream on your Qt application.

qtSmoothColorTransition
--------------
A demo that takes a grayscale image as input and performs a smooth color transition from a color palette using linear interpolation.

FruitClassification
--------------
A C++/OpenCV port of [a cool Python application](http://github.com/eliezerb/FruitClassification) that performs Oranges vs Apples classification using LDA.
